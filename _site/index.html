The 21st century has seen a considerable growth in robotics technologies. More and more advanced robots are being developed every day. From room cleaning robot Roomba to advanced medical robot DaVinci, robots are making way into human lives. It is widely expected that the robots will replace humans in many of the daily labor intensive and repetitive tasks in a very near future.
</p>
<p>
But one of the major challenges faced by even the most advanced robotic technologies lies in its inability to learn new tasks and skills like human beings, i.e from experiences and from demonstrations. The traditional method of teaching robots to perform new tasks is by programming each aspect of the task line by line. But it is not practical to program each and every task in such an detailed manner.The real solution for this problem lies in developing learning technologies for robots that could learn and then act just like human beings i.e. from examples and demonstrations. A 3 year old kid is taught something new by its parents not by algorithmic programming but rather by simple demonstrations. The kid is shown what to do by its parents and it learns to imitate from these behaviours. Even though researchers have been trying to address this problem for the past several years and are able to come up with several ways of tackling it, the field is still in its infancy and has a lot of room for development. More advanced algorithms has to be developed for making robots learn like human beings.
</p>
<p>
In this project we aim to tackle this problem by developing a robotic learning system that could efficiently learn new tasks by observing only the demonstrations. We term this as observation learning problem. In observation learning, the robot is made to observe a demonstrator performing a particular task. It is then made to learn to perform this task from these observations only. The novelty of this approach lies in the learning process where the robot learns a new task by only observing a demonstration without being explicitly programmed, there by providing a robot with human like learning capabilities.
</p>
<p>
This project envisions a future where robots could acquire new skills by just observing humans perform a task or even by watching online tutorial videos. In future the robots with these kind of learning systems could be applied in several real world conditions ranging from home to work environments. For examples the robotic systems equipped with the observation learning capabilities could be easily deployed into construction sites where it could learn to perform the relevant tasks such as drilling holes, hammering nails or screwing a bolt just by observing other workers.
